# TODO

## Functionnalities
[x] On mounted, get all filenames (full path) from ./assets into an array
[x] loop over this array with v-for, dynamically binding the src attribute to each img tag
[ ] Show full image on click (use something akin to a lightbox)

No need to bind an alt attribute, at least not dynamically.

## Styling
[ ] Effect on hover
